# 🎲 NumSum - A Simple Blockchain Guessing Game  

## 🧩 Project Description  
**NumSum** is a beginner-friendly decentralized guessing game built on **Ethereum** using **Solidity**.  
Players can bet a small amount of ETH and guess the **sum of two random numbers (0–9 each)**.  
If their guess is correct, they instantly win **2× their bet**!  

This project is designed for **learning smart contracts, randomness, and payouts** on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 💡 What It Does  
1. The player sends a small ETH bet along with their guess (0–18).  
2. The smart contract generates two pseudo-random digits (0–9).  
3. If the player’s guess equals the sum of those two digits, they win!  
4. The contract automatically transfers the reward back to the player.
